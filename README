This code can be used to compare a particular aspect of concurrency suppor in
Python and Erlang.

It was prepared for a presentation at the Chicago Python User Group on Sept
8, 2011.

This README is mostly random nodes. For a bit more structure, build the Sphinx
docs in the doc dir:

 - Install python-sphinx
 - Run "make html" in the doc dir
 - View the docs by opening doc/_build/html/index.html in a browser

* Factors

** Work Delay

** Listen backlog and SOMAXCON

/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn

** Resuing TIME_WAIT Sockets

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse

** Reducing TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT

echo 30 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout

** Log To Files

Logging rapidly to stdout can tie up CPU.

* Scratch

It's a challenge to actually get the number of concurrent handlers up to a
respectable level.
